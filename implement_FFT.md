5.    Implementations, Applications, and Case Studies:

Implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language(s). DO NOT ADD THE CODE TO THE REPORT.
Explore different implementation techniques, trade-offs, and optimizations.
Benchmark your implementations against other algorithms or existing libraries.
Investigate real-world applications of algorithms in various fields such as computer science, engineering, finance, and more to gain practical experience.
Understand how the algorithm solves specific problems in these domains.
Study case examples where the algorithm has been used to solve complex problems.
Analyze the strategies and adaptations applied in these cases.
